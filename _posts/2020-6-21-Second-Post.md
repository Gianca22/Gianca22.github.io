title: Getting started with Android Studio
---

Hii again!

Things are growing, yesterday I had one post, today I have two. <br>
Jokes apart, I downloaded Android Studio from [this website](https://developer.android.com/studio). As I do not have any knowledge of it, I decided to start following this [little tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFlPARW5IX8) of just 30 minutes. <br>

The first tutorial is quite simple and it's only about an easy design for adding two numbers.

<!-- I could put pictures here -->


You can find the code in [my repository](https://github.com/Gianca22) on GitHub.

See you soon
